      <h1>About me</h1>
      
      <p>My name is Miguel Luna born in a very small town in Oaxaca, Mexico. I lived in this small town, with a population of about 200 people till I 11 years old. My sibilings and I moved here to the United States in October, 2000 and I have lived here in Utah since then. While in High School I enrolled in a program called School of Technology, which had us enroll in special computer classes learning different aspects of it. Such as computer programing, drafting and multimedia. When I graduated High School I had been doing Concurrent Enrollment getting college credit, but deciding what I wanted to major in became the hardest thing I had to do. As a consequence I studied quite a few things, but I loved every single thing about them. At the end I decided to studied physics because I felt it would give me answers to questions that plague my mind at the time and while this was true, I also wanted to do something to change the world. I transfered to the University of Utah and almost graduated, but personal life interfered with my studies and I dropped out of the program in my last semester. A year later I enrolled again at SLCC and now I'm once again pursuing a degree in computer science.</p>
      
      
      <h2></h2>
      <p>Many people struggle to find their place in society. No one is exempt from this. When I graduated High School I thought I had an idea of what and where I wanted to be in life after college. This was not the case. I decided to start off my taking generals and since I had a few CIS credits from concurrent enrollment from High School, I decided on a CIS Degree. At this point I knew how to do basic C++ Programing and had been building my own computers, so it seemed logical to follow that.</p>
      <p>Over the years I have changed my major and studied Psychology, Mechanical Engineering and finally deciding on pursuing Physics. It was during time at the Salt Lake Community College that I discovered my love for mathematics and science. I then went on and transfer to the University of Utah where I continued to earn a Bachelors in Physics. During my last semester to receive my Physics Degree, I ran into some internal turmoil. I took a year off from school and came back, but now I decided I wanted to studied computer science once more.</p>
      <p>The reason for this change is quite complex, but feel free to inquire about it. If I were to give a short explanation or reason about it, I think this quote from my favorite teacher and friend would suffice for now, <blockquote>Knowledge for the sake of knowledge <br /><i>~Kyle Costello, Mathematics Professor at SLCC</i></blockqoute></p>
