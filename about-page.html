      <h1>About me</h1>
      
      <p>My name is Miguel Luna born in a very small town in Oaxaca, Mexico. I lived in this small town, with a population of about 200 people till I 11 years old. My sibilings and I moved here to the United States in October, 2000 and I have lived here in Utah since then. While in High School I enrolled in a program called School of Technology, which had us enroll in special computer classes learning different aspects of it. Such as computer programing, drafting and multimedia. When I graduated High School I had been doing Concurrent Enrollment getting college credit, but deciding what I wanted to major in became the hardest thing I had to do. As a consequence I studied quite a few things, but I loved every single thing about them. At the end I decided to studied physics because I felt it would give me answers to questions that plague my mind at the time and while this was true, I also wanted to do something to change the world. I transfered to the University of Utah and almost graduated, but personal life interfered with my studies and I dropped out of the program in my last semester. A year later I enrolled again at SLCC and now I'm once again pursuing a degree in computer science.</p>
      
      
      <h2>About my work</h2>
      <p>I've worked for a Marriott hotel since I was 17yrs old till I was 27yrs. For most of my work there I worked as a hotel engineer, which is what at one point in my school life made me choose Mechanical Engineering as my major and while I enjoyed every bit of it, once I learned that engineers don't actually work on the projects, but simply manage people and do paper work, I decided to go a different path. Then 3 years ago I moved to work in the Front office department and worked as a clerk and a Night Auditor for the hotel. I learned a great deal about accounting and more of the paperwork that happens for the hotel. Recently I moved to a new job, so now I work for Wells Fargo and as a Fraud Specialist and looking forward to see how high I can get in this company.</p>
