      <h1>About me</h1>
      
      <p>Thank you for visiting my ePortfolio. A site created and hosted by me displaying my understanding of Web Designing. In here I will showcase some of my works, my academic goals and outcomes, activities and events done outside of the classroom as well as a copy of my most recent Resume, and a little bit of an insight about me. </p>
      
      
      <h2>In search of my Vocation</h2>
      <p>Many people struggle to find their place in society. No one is exempt from this. When I graduated High School I thought I had an idea of what and where I wanted to be in life after college. This was not the case. I decided to start off my taking generals and since I had a few CIS credits from concurrent enrollment from High School, I decided on a CIS Degree. At this point I knew how to do basic C++ Programing and had been building my own computers, so it seemed logical to follow that.</p>
      <p>Over the years I have changed my major and studied Psychology, Mechanical Engineering and finally deciding on pursuing Physics. It was during time at the Salt Lake Community College that I discovered my love for mathematics and science. I then went on and transfer to the University of Utah where I continued to earn a Bachelors in Physics. During my last semester to receive my Physics Degree, I ran into some internal turmoil. I took a year off from school and came back, but now I decided I wanted to studied computer science once more.</p>
      <p>The reason for this change is quite complex, but feel free to inquire about it. If I were to give a short explanation or reason about it, I think this quote from my favorite teacher and friend would suffice for now, <blockquote>Knowledge for the sake of knowledge <br /><i>~Kyle Costello, Mathematics Professor at SLCC</i></blockqoute></p>
